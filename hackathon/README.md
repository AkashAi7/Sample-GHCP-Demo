## 🎯 Tips for Success

### Copilot Best Practices
1. **Be specific** in your prompts
2. **Use @workspace** for multi-file context

2. **Plan your approach** (2-3 minutes)
3. **Use Copilot Chat** for questions
4. **Test incrementally** as you build
5. **Document as you go**

### Common Pitfalls
- ❌ Accepting code without understanding
