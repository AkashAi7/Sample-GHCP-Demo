# Smart Home Energy Monitor

This is a sample project for demonstrating GitHub Copilot capabilities. It simulates a smart home energy monitoring system.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `exercises/`: **New!** Interactive learning modules for GitHub Copilot.
- `models/`: Contains data models for Devices and Readings.
- `services/`: Contains logic for data ingestion and analytics.
- `data/`: Contains sample CSV data files.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Loads energy reading data from CSV files.
- **Analytics**: Calculates efficiency scores and projects monthly costs.
- **Budget Monitoring**: Checks if projected costs exceed a defined budget.
